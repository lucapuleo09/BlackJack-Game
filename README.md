Created a Blackjack Simulation for my OPIM 3220 Course. Game deals your hand and the dealers hand and asks user to hit or stand. User inputs h or s. If over 21, player busts, and dealer wins.
If under 21 it will ask again, until you either bust, or input stand. If dealer busts, you win. If tied, it pushes.
